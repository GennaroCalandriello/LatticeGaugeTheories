# LatticeGaugeTheories
This repository simulates the behavior of pure SU2 and SU3 lattice gauge theories using Metropolis, Heat Bath and Over Relaxation updating algorithms. Here is one result for N=5 space-time extension of the lattice, for beta varying in range 0.1-8.0 and for 2 different Wilson Loop extensions. You can compare those results with Gattringer
