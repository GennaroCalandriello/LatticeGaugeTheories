# LatticeGaugeTheories
This repository simulates the behavior of pure SU2 and SU3 lattice gauge theories using Metropolis, Heat Bath and Over Relaxation updating algorithms. Here is one result for N=5 space-time extension of the lattice, for beta varying in range 0.1-8.0 and for 2 different Wilson Loop extensions, referred to a SU(3) theory. You can compare those results with Gattringer

For the SU(2) pure gauge the results obtained with the 3 algorithms are the following (Wilson loop calculated for 3 different spacetime extensions: W11, W22, W33):
Heat-Bath + 2 Over-relaxation for each measure
